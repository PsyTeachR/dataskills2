### Setup

```{r libraries, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# libraries needed for these examples
library(tidyverse)
```

All the joins have this basic syntax:

`****_join(x, y, by = NULL, suffix = c(".x", ".y")`

* `x` = the first (left) table
* `y` = the second (right) table
* `by` = what columns to match on. If you leave this blank, it will match on all columns with the same names in the two tables.
* `suffix` = if columns have the same name in the two tables, but you aren't joining by them, they get a suffix to make them unambiguous. This defaults to ".x" and ".y", but you can change it to something more meaningful.

### Data

First, we'll create two small data tables. 

`subject` has id, sex and age for subjects 1-5. Age and sex are missing for subject 3.

```{r subject}
subject <- tibble(
  id = seq(1,5),
  sex = c("m", "m", NA, "f", "f"),
  age = c(19, 22, NA, 19, 18)
)

subject
```

`exp` has subject id and the score from an experiment. Some subjects are missing, 
some completed twice, and some are not in the subject table.

```{r exp}
exp <- tibble(
  id = c(2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7),
  score = c(10, 18, 21, 23, 9, 11, 11, 12, 3)
)

exp
```


### left_join()
<a name="left_join"></a>

<img src='images/joins/left_join.png' class='join'>
A `left_join` keeps all the data from the first (left) table and joins anything 
that matches from the second (right) table. If the right table has more than one match for 
a row in the right table, there will be more than one row in the joined table 
(see ids 4 and 5).

```{r left_join}
left_join(subject, exp, by = "id")
```

You can leave out the `by` argument if you're matching on all of the columns with 
the same name, but it's good practice to always specify it so your code is robust 
to changes in the loaded data.

<img src='images/joins/left_join_rev.png' class='join'>
The order of tables is swapped here, so the result is all rows from the `exp` 
table joined to any matching rows from the `subject` table.

```{r left_join-2}
left_join(exp, subject, by = "id")
```

### right_join()
<a name="right_join"></a>

<img src='images/joins/right_join.png' class='join'>
A `right_join` keeps all the data from the second (right) table and joins anything 
that matches from the first (left) table. 

```{r right_join}
right_join(subject, exp, by = "id")
```

<p class="alert alert-info">This table has the same information as 
`left_join(exp, subject, by = "id")`, but the columns are in a different order 
(left table, then right table).</p>

### inner_join()
<a name="inner_join"></a>

<img src='images/joins/inner_join.png' class='join'>
An `inner_join` returns all the rows that have a match in the other table.

```{r inner_join}
inner_join(subject, exp, by = "id")
```


### full_join()
<a name="full_join"></a>

<img src='images/joins/full_join.png' class='join'>
A `full_join` lets you join up rows in two tables while keeping all of the 
information from both tables. If a row doesn't have a match in the other table, 
the other table's column values are set to `NA`.

```{r full_join}
full_join(subject, exp, by = "id")
```

### semi_join()
<a name="semi_join"></a>

<img src='images/joins/semi_join.png' class='join'>
A `semi_join` returns all rows from the left table where there are matching values 
in the right table, keeping just columns from the left table.

```{r semi_join}
semi_join(subject, exp, by = "id")
```

<p class="alert alert-info">Unlike an inner join, a semi join will never duplicate 
the rows in the left table if there is more than one maching row in the right table.</p>

<img src='images/joins/semi_join_rev.png' class='join'>
Order matters in a semi join.

```{r semi_join-2}
semi_join(exp, subject, by = "id")
```

### anti_join()
<a name="anti_join"></a>

<img src='images/joins/anti_join.png' class='join'>
A `anti_join` return all rows from the left table where there are *not* matching 
values in the right table, keeping just columns from the left table.

```{r anti_join}
anti_join(subject, exp, by = "id")
```

<img src='images/joins/anti_join_rev.png' class='join'>
Order matters in an anti join.

```{r anti_join-2}
anti_join(exp, subject, by = "id")
```

### bind_rows()
<a name="bind_rows"></a>

You can combine the rows of two tables with `bind_rows`.

Here we'll add subject data for subjects 6-9 and bind that to the original subject table.

```{r bind_rows}
new_subjects <- tibble(
  id = seq(6, 9),
  sex = c("m", "m", "f", "f"),
  age = c(19, 16, 20, 19)
)

bind_rows(subject, new_subjects)
```

The columns just have to have the same names, they don't have to be in the same order. 
Any columns that differ between the two tables will just have `NA` values for entries 
from the other table.

If a row is duplicated between the two tables (like id 5 below), the row will also
be duplicated in the resulting table. If your tables have the exact same columns, 
you can use `union()` (see below) to avoid duplicates.

```{r}
new_subjects <- tibble(
  id = seq(5, 9),
  age = c(18, 19, 16, 20, 19),
  sex = c("f", "m", "m", "f", "f"),
  new = c(1,2,3,4,5)
)

bind_rows(subject, new_subjects)
```

### bind_cols()
<a name="bind_cols"></a>

You can merge two tables with the same number of rows using `bind_cols`. This is 
only useful if the two tables have their rows in the exact same order. The only 
advantage over a left join is when the tables don't have any IDs to join by and 
you have to rely solely on their order.

```{r bind_cols}
new_info <- tibble(
  colour = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue")
)

bind_cols(subject, new_info)
```

### intersect()
<a name="intersect"></a>

`intersect()` returns all rows in two tables that match exactly. The columns 
don't have to be in the same order.

```{r intersect}
new_subjects <- tibble(
  id = seq(4, 9),
  age = c(19, 18, 19, 16, 20, 19),
  sex = c("f", "f", "m", "m", "f", "f")
)

dplyr::intersect(subject, new_subjects)

```


### union()
<a name="union"></a>

`union()` returns all the rows from both tables, removing duplicate rows.

```{r union}
dplyr::union(subject, new_subjects)
```

### setdiff()
<a name="setdiff"></a>

`setdiff` returns rows that are in the first table, but not in the second table.

```{r setdiff}
setdiff(subject, new_subjects)
```

Order matters for `setdiff`.

```{r setdiff-order}
setdiff(new_subjects, subject)
```

## Example

### Load and process data

These data and cleaning code are from [Data cleaning](03_tidyr.html)

```{r}

# load country data from a CSV file on the web
library(readxl)
ccodes <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/master/all/all.csv")

infmort <- read_csv("data/infmort.csv") %>%  # load infant mortality data from a CSV file
  separate(                                  # separate the stats column into its 3 parts
    3, 
    c("rate", "ci_low", "ci_hi"), 
    extra = "drop", 
    sep = "(\\[|-|])", 
    convert = TRUE
  )

matmort <- read_xls("data/matmort.xls") %>%   # load maternal mortality data from an excel file
  gather("Year", "stats", `1990`:`2015`) %>%  # convert to long format
  mutate(stats = gsub(" ", "", stats)) %>%    # get rid of spaces in stats column
  separate(                                   # separate the stats column into its 3 parts
    stats, 
    c("rate", "ci_low", "ci_hi"), 
    extra = "drop", 
    convert = TRUE
  )

```

### inner_join()

`inner_join(x, y, by = NULL, suffix = c(".x", ".y")`

```{r, eval = FALSE}

infmatmort <- inner_join(matmort, infmort, by = c("Country", "Year"))

```

<pre><code>Error in inner_join_impl(x, y, by$x, by$y, suffix$x, suffix$y, check_na_matches(na_matches)) : 
  Can't join on 'Year' x 'Year' because of incompatible types (character / integer)</code></pre>

#### Incompatible tpyes

Oops. `Year` is an integer type in `infmort` and a character type in `matmort`. 
We can fix that by adding `convert = TRUE` to the `gather` function.

```{r}

matmort <- read_xls("data/matmort.xls") %>%   
  gather("Year", "stats", `1990`:`2015`, convert = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(stats = gsub(" ", "", stats)) %>%
  separate(
    stats, 
    c("rate", "ci_low", "ci_hi"), 
    extra = "drop", 
    convert = TRUE
  )

infmatmort <- inner_join(matmort, infmort, by = c("Country", "Year"))

head(infmatmort)

```

#### Disambiguate duplicate column names with `suffix`

Maybe we shouldn't have given the rates and CIs the same names in the infant and 
maternal mortality tables if we were going to join them. We could fix that by 
changing the names in the `separate` functions to be unique. Here, we'll add the 
suffixes "_mat" and "_inf" to distinguish them.

```{r}

infmatmort <- inner_join(
  matmort, 
  infmort, 
  by = c("Country", "Year"),
  suffix = c("_mat", "_inf")
)

head(infmatmort)

```

### full_join()

`full_join(x, y, by = NULL, suffix = c(".x", ".y")`

A full join lets you join up rows in two tables while keeping all of the 
information from both tables. If a row doesn't have a match in the other table, 
the other table's column values are set to `NA`.

```{r}

infmatmort <- full_join(
  matmort, 
  infmort, 
  by = c("Country", "Year"),
  suffix = c("_mat", "_inf")
)

infmatmort %>% filter(Country == "Djibouti", Year < 1993)

```

### left_join()

`left_join(x, y, by = NULL, suffix = c(".x", ".y")`

Use a `left_join()` if you want to keep all the data in the main (x, left) table 
and join data from another (y, right) table if it exists.

<p class="alert alert-warning">Notice that the `by` argument now needs to specify both the left 
and right tables' columns (`by = c("Country" = "name")`) because we're joining 
on columns that have different names.</p>


```{r}
infmatmort_region <- infmatmort %>%
  left_join(ccodes, by = c("Country" = "name"))

head(infmatmort_region)
```

### right_join()

`right_join(x, y, by = NULL, suffix = c(".x", ".y")`

We really just wanted the region, not all the extra data from the country codes. 
We can just select the columns we want when we load the country codes data. 

If we start with the `ccodes` table, we can `right_join()` the `infmatmort` table, 
which is just the opposite of a left join (keeps all the data from the "right" 
joined table and any data from the "left" table that matches). 

<p class="alert alert-warning">Remember to switch 
the order of the `by` columns if they have different names in the main and 
optional data tables.</p>

```{r}

infmatmort_region <- ccodes %>%
  select(name, region) %>%
  right_join(infmatmort, by = c("name" = "Country"))

head(infmatmort_region)

```


### Plot maternal vs infant mortality by region

So let's make a graph that we couldn't have easily made with 3 separate data tables

```{r}
infmatmort_region %>%
  filter(Year == 1990) %>%
  group_by(name, region) %>%
  summarise(
    matmort = mean(rate_mat),
    infmort = mean(rate_inf)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(infmort, matmort, colour = region)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(.~region)
```
-->

## Exercises

### Mutating joins

Load data from [disgust_scores.csv](data/disgust_scores.csv), 
[personality_scores.csv](data/personality_scores.csv) and [users.csv](data/users.csv). 
Each participant is identified by a unique `user_id`.

1. Add participant data to the disgust table.

    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-1, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
    disgust <- read_csv("data/disgust_scores.csv")
    ocean <- read_csv("data/personality_scores.csv")
    user <- read_csv("data/users.csv")

    study1 <- left_join(disgust, user, by = "user_id")
    
    head(study1)
    ```
    </div>
    
    *Intermediate*: Calculate the age of each participant on the date they did the disgust questionnaire. Round to the nearest tenth of a year.
    
    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-1-i, message = FALSE}
    library(lubridate)
    
    study1_ages <- study1 %>%
      mutate(
        age = date - birthday,
        age_days = as.integer(age),
        age_years = round(age_days/365.25, 1)
      )
    
    study1_ages %>%
      select(date, birthday:age_years) %>%
      head()
    ```
    </div>

2. Add the participant data to the disgust data, but have the columns from the participant table first.

    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-2}
    study2 <- right_join(user, disgust, by = "user_id")
    head(study2)
    ```
    </div>
    
    *Intermediate*: How many times was the disgust questionnaire completed by each sex?
    
    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-2-i}
    study2 %>%
      group_by(sex) %>%
      summarise(n = n())
    ```
    </div>
    
    *Advanced*: Make a graph of how many people completed the questionnaire each year.
    
    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-2-a, message = FALSE}
    study2 %>%
      mutate(year = substr(date, 1, 4)) %>%
      group_by(year) %>%
      summarise(times_completed = n()) %>%
      ggplot() +
      geom_col(aes(year, times_completed, fill = year)) +
      labs(
        x = "Year",
        y = "Times Completed"
      ) +
      guides(fill = FALSE)
      
    ```
    </div>

3. Create a table with only disgust and personality data from the same `user_id` collected on the same `date`.

    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-3}
    study3 <- inner_join(disgust, ocean, by = c("user_id", "date"))
    head(study3)
    ```
    </div> 
    
    *Intermediate*: Join data from the same `user_id`, regardless of `date`. Does this give you the same data table as above?
    
    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-3-i}
    study3_nodate <- inner_join(disgust, ocean, by = c("user_id"))
    head(study3_nodate)
    ```
    </div> 
    

4. Create a table of the disgust and personality data with each `user_id:date` on a single row, containing _all_ of the data from both tables.

    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-4}
    study4 <- full_join(disgust, ocean, by = c("user_id", "date"))
    head(study4)
    ```
    </div>

### Filtering joins

5. Create a table of just the data from the disgust table for users who completed the personality questionnaire that same day.

    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-5}
    study5 <- semi_join(disgust, ocean, by = c("user_id", "date"))
    head(study5)
    ```
    </div>
    
6. Create a table of data from users who did not complete either the personality questionnaire or the disgust questionnaire. (_Hint: this will require two steps; use pipes._)

    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-6}
    study6 <- user %>%
      anti_join(ocean, by = "user_id") %>%
      anti_join(disgust, by = "user_id")
    head(study6)
    ```
    </div>

### Binding and sets

7. Load new user data from [users2.csv](data/users2.csv). Bind them into a single table.

    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-7, message = FALSE}
    user2 <- read_csv("data/users2.csv")
    users_all <- bind_rows(user, user2)
    head(users_all)
    ```
    </div>

8. How many users are in both the first and second user table?

    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-8}
    dplyr::intersect(user, user2) %>% nrow()
    ```
    </div>

9. How many unique users are there in total across the first and second user tables?

    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-9}
    dplyr::union(user, user2) %>% nrow()
    ```
    </div>

10. How many users are in the first, but not the second, user table?

    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-10}
    dplyr::setdiff(user, user2) %>% nrow()
    ```
    </div>

11. How many users are in the second, but not the first, user table?

    <div class="solution"><button>Solution</button>
    ```{r ex-11}
    dplyr::setdiff(user2, user) %>% nrow()
    ```
    </div>
