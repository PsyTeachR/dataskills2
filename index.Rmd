# Overview

This course provides an overview of skills needed for reproducible research and 
open science using the statistical programming language R.  Students will learn 
about data visualisation, data tidying and wrangling, archiving, iteration and 
functions, probability and data simulations, general linear models, and 
reproducible workflows. Learning is reinforced through weekly assignments that 
involve working with different types of data.



It is taught by [Dale Barr](http://talklab.psy.gla.ac.uk/) and [Lisa DeBruine](https://debruine.github.io).


## Course Aims

This course aims to teach students the basic principles of reproducible research 
and to provide practical training in data processing and analysis in the 
statistical programming language R.


## Intended Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course students will be able to:

* write scripts in R to organise and transform data sets using best accepted practices;
* explain basics of probability and its role in statistical inference;
* analyse data and report descriptive and inferential statistics in a reproducible manner.

## Formative Exercises

Exercises are available at the end of each lesson's webpage. These are not marked 
or mandatory, but if you can work through each of these (using web resources, of 
course), you will easily complete the marked assessments. 


* [01 Intro](formative_exercises/01_intro_stub.Rmd): Intro to R, functions
* [02 Intro](formative_exercises/02_intro_stub.Rmd): Vectors, tabular data, data import, pipes
* [Essential Skills](formative_exercises/essential_skills_stub.Rmd): You must be able to complete these exercises to advance in the class beyond the first two lectures
* [03 ggplot](formative_exercises/03_ggplot_stub.Rmd): Data visualisation
* [04 wrangle1](formative_exercises/04_wrangle1_stub.Rmd): Data wrangling (mostly tidyr)
* [05 wrangle2](formative_exercises/05_wrangle2_stub.Rmd): Data wrangling (mostly dplyr)
* [06 joins](formative_exercises/06_joins_stub.Rmd): Data relations
* [07 functions](formative_exercises/07_functions_stub.Rmd): Functions and Iteration
* [08 simulation](formative_exercises/08_simulations_stub.Rmd): Simulation
