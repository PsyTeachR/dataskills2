```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# please do not alter this code chunk
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = TRUE)

Generate a violin plot, boxplot, histogram, density plot, and column plot for the following data. 

```{r dogs}
# do not edit this chunk
# dog weights estimated from http://petobesityprevention.org/ideal-weight-ranges/

set.seed(0) # makes sure random numbers are reproducible

dogs <- tibble(
  breed = rep(c("beagle", "boxer", "bulldog"), each = 100),
  weight = c(
    rnorm(100, 24, 6),
    rnorm(100, 62.5, 12.5),
    rnorm(100, 45, 5)
  )
)

```


## Violin Plot

```{r exercise-violin}
dog_violin <- NULL

dog_violin # prints the plot below
```


## Boxplot

```{r exercise-boxplot}
dog_boxplot <- NULL

dog_boxplot # prints the plot below
```


## Histogram

```{r exercise-histogram}
dog_histogram <- NULL

dog_histogram # prints the plot below
```


## Density plot

```{r exercise-density}
dog_density <- NULL

dog_density # prints the plot below
```


## Column Plot

```{r exercise-colplot}
dog_column <- NULL

dog_column # prints the plot below
```

## Grid

Create a grid of the first four plot styles (exclude the column plot). (Hint: use a function from cowplot).

```{r exercise-dog-advanced}
dog_grid <- NULL

dog_grid # prints the plot below
```

## Changing defaults

For the five plots above, change the axis labels so the x-axis reads "Breed of Dog" or "Weight of Dog" (depending on the plot type) and the y-axis reads "Weight of Dog", "Number of Dogs", or "Density of Dogs" (depending on the plot type).

Change the default colours to "orange", "dodgerblue", and "hotpink".

Add a title to each plot describing the plot type.

Save each plot as a PNG file with the names "dog_violin.png", "dog_boxplot.png","dog_histogram.png", "dog_density.png", and "dog_column.png" (the names are important so they show up in the code below).

```{r exercise-dog-intermediate}
# Hint: you can add changes to an existing plot, e.g.:
# dog_density + xlim(0, 100)
```



```{r}
# do not change; displays the images saved above
knitr::include_graphics("dog_violin.png")
knitr::include_graphics("dog_boxplot.png")
knitr::include_graphics("dog_histogram.png")
knitr::include_graphics("dog_column.png")
knitr::include_graphics("dog_violin.png")
```


## Line plot

Represent the relationships among disgust subscales from the dataset [disgust_scores.csv](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/disgust_scores.csv) (or `dataskills::disgust_scores`).

Graph the linear relationship between moral and pathogen disgust. Make sure the axes run from the minimum to maximum possible scores on both axes. Give the graph an appropriate title and axis labels.
  
```{r exercise-cor-basic, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
disgust_scatterplot <- NULL

disgust_scatterplot # prints the plot below
```


## Many correlated variables

Create a heatmap of the relationships among all the questions in [disgust_cors.csv](https://psyteachr.github.io/msc-data-skills/data/disgust_cors.csv)  (or `dataskills::disgust_cors`). The correlations have already been calculated for you. 

*Bonus*: Figure out how to rotate the text on the x-axis so it's readable.

```{r exercise-heatmap}
disgust_heatmap <- NULL

disgust_heatmap # prints the plot below
```

## Density plot

Create a 2d density plot of the relationship between pathogen and sexual disgust for `disgust_scores`. 

Use `stat_density_2d(aes(fill = ..level..), geom = "polygon", n = n, 
h = h)`, set n and h to values that make the graph look good, and 
figure out what `n` and `h` represent.

```{r exercise-density2d, warning=FALSE}
disgust_density <- NULL

disgust_density # prints the plot below
```



## Advanced Grid

Create a 3x3 grid of plots with columns representing the x-axis and rows representing the y-axis and assign it to `disgust_grid`. Put a density plot of each variable along the diagonal. Make sure the graphs have appropriate titles and axis labels and that the range of the axes are the same in all graphs.

|              | moral   | sexual  | pathogen |
|--------------|---------|---------|----------|
| **moral**    | density | line    | line     | 
| **sexual**   | line    | density | line     |
| **pathogen** | line    | line    | density  |


```{r exercise-cor-advanced, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Hint: set up your 9 separate plots first

disgust_grid <- NULL

disgust_grid # prints the plot below
```
