# Overview {-}

<div class="small_right"><img src="images/logo.png" alt="Hex sticker, blue, text: Repro Res" /></div>

This book provides an overview of skills needed for reproducible research and open science using the statistical programming language R and tidyverse packages. It covers data visualisation, data tidying and wrangling, archiving, iteration and functions, probability and data simulations, general linear models, and reproducible workflows.

The book is also available in [ePub](reprores-v2.epub) and [Kindle](reprores-v2.mobi) formats.

## Course Resources {-}

* [Data Skills Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA2iRWVwbpTIweEBHD2dOKjZHK1atRmXt){target="_blank"}
    Each chapter has several short video lectures for the main learning outcomes. The videos are captioned and watching with the captioning on is a useful way to learn the jargon of computational reproducibility. If you cannot access YouTube, the videos are available by request. **The book chapters have changed order in version 2, so the playlist is not yet in the same order as the book, but each chapter links to the relevant playlist videos.**

* [reprores](https://github.com/psyteachr/reprores-v2){target="_blank"}
    This is a custom R package for this course. You can install it with the code below. It will download all of the packages that are used in the book, along with an offline copy of this book, the shiny apps used in the book, and the exercises.
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    devtools::install_github("psyteachr/reprores-v2")
    ```

* [glossary](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary){target="_blank"}
    Coding and statistics both have a lot of specialist terms. Throughout this book, jargon will be linked to the glossary.

## I found a bug! {-}

This book is a work in progress, so you might find errors. Please help me fix them! The best way is to open an [issue on github](https://github.com/PsyTeachR/reprores-v2/issues){target="_blank"} that describes the error, but you can also mention it on the class Teams forum or [email Lisa](mailto:lisa.debruine@glasgow.ac.uk?subject=reprores).
