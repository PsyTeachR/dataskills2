## Why learn reproducible reports?

Have you ever worked on a report, creating a summary table for the demographics, making beautiful plots, getting the analysis just right, and copying all the relevant numbers into your manuscript, only to find out that you forgot to exclude a test run and have to redo everything?

An R Markdown document produces a `r glossary("reproducibility", "reproducible")` report that fixes this problem. Although this requires a bit of extra effort at the start, it will more than pay you back by allowing you to update your entire report with the push of a button whenever anything changes.

Studies also show that many, if not most, papers in the scientific literature have reporting errors. For example, more than half of over 250,000 psychology papers published between 1985 and 2013 have at least one value that is statistically incompatible (e.g., a p-value that is not possible given a t-value and degrees of freedom) [@nuijten2016prevalence]. Reproducible reports help avoid transcription and rounding errors.

We will make reproducible reports following the principles of [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). The basic idea is to have the text of the report together in a single document along with the code needed to perform all analyses and generate the tables. The report is then "compiled" from the original format into some other, more portable format, such as HTML or PDF. This is different from traditional cutting and pasting approaches where, for instance, you create a graph in Microsoft Excel or a statistics program like SPSS and then paste it into Microsoft Word.

## Organising a project {#projects}

First, we need to get orgainsed.

`r glossary("project", "Projects")` in RStudio are a way to group all of the files you need for one project. Most projects include scripts, data files, and output files like the PDF version of the script or images.

::: {.try data-latex=""}
Make a new directory where you will keep all of your materials for this class. If you're using a lab computer, make sure you make this directory in your network drive so you can access it from other computers. 

Choose **`New Project...`** under the **`File`** menu to create a new project called `01-repro` in this directory.
:::


### Working Directory

Where should you put all of your files? When developing an analysis, you usually want to have all of your scripts and data files in one subtree of your computer's directory structure. Usually there is a single `r glossary("working directory")` where your data and scripts are stored.

Your script should only reference files in three locations, using the appropriate format.

| Where                    | Example |
|--------------------------|---------|
| on the web               | "https://psyteachr.github.io/psyteachr/data/disgust_scores.csv" |
| in the working directory | "disgust_scores.csv"  |
| in a subdirectory        | "data/disgust_scores.csv" |

::: {.warning data-latex=""}
Never set or change your working directory in a script. 
:::

If you are working with an R Markdown file, it will automatically use the same directory the .Rmd file is in as the working directory. 

If you are working with R scripts, store your main script file in the top-level directory and manually set your working directory to that location. You will have to reset the working directory each time you open RStudio, unless you create a `r glossary("project")` and access the script from the project. 

For instance, if you are on a Windows machine your data and scripts are in the directory `C:\Carla's_files\thesis2\my_thesis\new_analysis`, you will set your working directory in one of two ways: (1) by going to the `Session` pull down menu in RStudio and choosing `Set Working Directory`, or (2) by typing `setwd("C:\Carla's_files\thesis2\my_thesis\new_analysis")` in the console window.

::: {.warning data-latex=""}
It's tempting to make your life simple by putting the `setwd()` command in your script. Don't do this! Others will not have the same directory tree as you (and when your laptop dies and you get a new one, neither will you).

When manually setting the working directory, always do so by using the **`Session > Set Working Directory`** pull-down option or by typing `setwd()` in the console.
:::

If your script needs a file in a subdirectory of `new_analysis`, say, `data/questionnaire.csv`, load it in using a `r glossary("relative path")` so that it is accessible if you move the folder `new_analysis` to another location or computer:

```{r read-csv, eval = FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("data/questionnaire.csv")  # correct
```

Do not load it in using an `r glossary("absolute path")`:

```{r abs-path, eval = FALSE}
dat <- read_csv("C:/Carla's_files/thesis22/my_thesis/new_analysis/data/questionnaire.csv")   # wrong
```

::: {.info data-latex=""}
Also note the convention of using forward slashes, unlike the Windows-specific convention of using backward slashes. This is to make references to files platform independent.
:::



## R Markdown

In this lesson, we will learn to make an R Markdown document with a table of contents, appropriate headers, code chunks, tables, images, inline R, and a bibliography. 

We will use `r glossary("R Markdown")` to create reproducible reports, which enables mixing of text and code. A reproducible script will contain sections of code in code blocks. A code block starts and ends with backtick symbols in a row, with some information about the code between curly brackets, such as `{r chunk-name, echo=FALSE}` (this runs the code, but does not show the text of the code block in the compiled document). The text outside of code blocks is written in `r glossary("markdown")`, which is a way to specify formatting, such as headers, paragraphs, lists, bolding, and links.

```{r img-reproducibleScript, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A reproducible script."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/01/reproducibleScript.png")
```

If you open up a new R Markdown file from a template, you will see an example document with several code blocks in it. To create an HTML or PDF report from an R Markdown (Rmd) document, you compile it.  Compiling a document is called `r glossary("knit", "knitting")` in RStudio. There is a button that looks like a ball of yarn with needles through it that you click on to compile your file into a report. 

```{block, type="try"}
Create a new R Markdown file from the **`File > New File > R Markdown...`** menu. Change the title and author, then click the knit button to create an html file.
```


### YAML Header

The `r glossary("YAML")` header is where you can set several options. 

```
---
title: "My Demo Document"
author: "Me"
output:
  html_document:
    df_print: kable
    theme: spacelab
    highlight: tango
    toc: true
    toc_float:
      collapsed: false
      smooth_scroll: false
    toc_depth: 3
    number_sections: false
---
```

The `df_print: kable` option prints data frames using `knitr::kable`. You'll learn below how to further customise tables.

The built-in themes are: "cerulean", "cosmo", "flatly", "journal", "lumen", "paper", "readable", "sandstone", "simplex", "spacelab", "united", and "yeti". You can [view and download more themes](http://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/).

<p class="alert alert-info">Try changing the values from `false` to `true` to see what the options do.</p>


### Setup

When you create a new R Markdown file in RStudio, a setup chunk is automatically created.

```{r knitr-setup, eval=FALSE, verbatim="r setup, include=FALSE"}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

You can set more default options for code chunks here. See the [knitr options documentation](https://yihui.name/knitr/options/){target="_blank"} for explanations of the possible options.

```{r knitr-setup2, eval=FALSE, verbatim="r setup, include=FALSE"}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width  = 8, 
  fig.height = 5, 
  fig.path   = 'images/',
  echo       = FALSE, 
  warning    = TRUE, 
  message    = FALSE,
  cache      = FALSE
)
```

The code above sets the following options:

* `fig.width  = 8` : default figure width is 8 inches (you can change this for individual figures)
* `fig.height = 5` : default figure height is 5 inches
* `fig.path   = 'images/'` : figures are saved in the directory "images"
* `echo       = FALSE` : do not show code chunks in the rendered document
* `warning    = FALSE` : do not show any function warnings
* `message    = FALSE` : do not show any function messages
* `cache      = FALSE` : run all the code to create all of the images and objects each time you knit (set to `TRUE` if you have time-consuming code)

You can also add the packages you need in this chunk using `library()`. Often when you are working on a script, you will realize that you need to load another add-on package. Don't bury the call to `library(package_I_need)` way down in the script. Put it in the top, so the user has an overview of what packages are needed.

::: {.try data-latex=""}
We'll be using function from the package `tidyverse`, so load that in your setup chunk.
:::

### Structure {#structure}

If you include a table of contents (`toc`), it is created from your document headers. Headers in `r glossary("markdown")` are created by prefacing the header title with one or more hashes (`#`). 

Use the following structure when developing your own analysis scripts: 

* load in any add-on packages you need to use
* define any custom functions
* load or simulate the data you will be working with
* work with the data
* save anything you need to save

::: {.try data-latex=""}
Delete the default text and add some structure to your document by creating headers and subheaders. We're going to load some data, create a summary table, plot the data, and analyse it.
:::

### Code Chunks

You can include `r glossary("chunk", "code chunks")` that create and display images, tables, or computations to include in your text. Let's start by loading some data.

First, create a code chunk in your document. This code loads some data from the web. 

```{r}
pets <- read_csv("https://psyteachr.github.io/psyteachr/data/pets.csv")
```

#### Comments

You can add comments inside R chunks with the hash symbol (`#`). The R interpreter will ignore characters from the hash to the end of the line.

```{r}
# simulating new data

n <- nrow(pets) # the total number of pet
mu <- mean(pets$score) # the mean score for all pets
sd <- sd(pets$score) # the SD for score for all pets

simulated_scores <- rnorm(n, mu, sd)
```

It's usually good practice to start a code chunk with a comment that explains what you're doing there, especially if the code is not explained in the text of the report.

If you name your objects clearly, you often don't need to add clarifying comments. For example, if I'd named the three objects above `total_pet_n`, `mean_score` and `sd_score`, I would omit the comments.

It's a bit of an art to comment your code well. The best way to develop this skill is to read a lot of other people's code and have others review your code. 

#### Tables

Next, create a code chunk where you want to display a table of the descriptives (e.g., Participants section of the Methods). We'll use tidyverse functions you will learn in the [data wrangling lectures](#tidyr) to create summary statistics for each group.

```{r}
pets %>%
  group_by(pet) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_weight = mean(weight),
    mean_score = mean(score)
  )
```

The table above is OK, but it could be more reader-friendly by changing the column labels, rounding the means, and adding a caption. You can use `knitr::kable()` for this.

```{r}
summary_table <-pets %>%
  group_by(pet) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_weight = mean(weight),
    mean_score = mean(score)
  )

newnames <- c("Pet Type", "N", "Mean Weight", "Mean Score")

knitr::kable(summary_table, 
             digits = 2, 
             col.names = newnames,
             caption = "Summary statistics for the pets dataset.")
```


<p class="alert alert-info">Notice that the r chunk specifies the option `results='asis'`. This lets you format the table using the `kable()` function from `knitr`. You can also use more specialised functions from [papaja](https://crsh.github.io/papaja_man/reporting.html#tables) or [kableExtra](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/awesome_table_in_html.html) to format your tables.</p>

#### Images

Next, create a code chunk where you want to display an image in your document. Let's put it in the Results section. We'll use some code that you'll learn more about  in the [data visualisation lecture](#ggplot) to show violin-boxplots for the groups.

Notice how the figure caption is formatted in the chunk options.

````
```{r, fig.cap="Figure 1. Scores by pet type and country."}
ggplot(pets, aes(pet, score, fill = country)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.25, 
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
               show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("orange", "dodgerblue")) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Score") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20, family = "Times"))
```
````

```{r, fig.cap="Figure 1. Scores by pet type and country.", echo=F}
ggplot(pets, aes(pet, score, fill = country)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.25, 
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.9),
               show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("orange", "dodgerblue")) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Score") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20, family = "Times"))
```

::: {.info data-latex=""}
The last line changes the default text size and font, which can be useful for generating figures that meet a journal's requirements.
:::

You can also include images that you did not create in R using the typical markdown syntax for images: 

```
![All the Things by [Hyperbole and a Half](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/)](images/memes/x-all-the-things.png)
```

![All the Things by [Hyperbole and a Half](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/)](images/memes/x-all-the-things.png)

#### In-line R

Now let's analyse the pets data to see if cats are heavier than ferrets. First we'll run the analysis code. Then we'll save any numbers we might want to use in our manuscript to variables and round them appropriately. Finally, we'll use `glue::glue()` to format a results string.

```{r}
# analysis
cat_weight <- filter(pets, pet == "cat") %>% pull(weight)
ferret_weight <- filter(pets, pet == "ferret") %>% pull(weight)
weight_test <- t.test(cat_weight, ferret_weight)

# round individual values you want to report
t <- weight_test$statistic %>% round(2)
df <- weight_test$parameter %>% round(1)
p <- weight_test$p.value %>% round(3)
# handle p-values < .001
p_symbol <- ifelse(p < .001, "<", "=")
if (p < .001) p <- .001

# format the results string
weight_result <- glue::glue("t = {t}, df = {df}, p {p_symbol} {p}")
```

You can insert the results into a paragraph with inline R code that looks like this: 

<pre><code>Cats were significantly heavier than ferrets (&#96;r weight_result&#96;).</code></pre>

**Rendered text:**  
Cats were significantly heavier than ferrets (`r weight_result`). 



### Bibliography

There are several ways to do in-text citations and automatically generate a [bibliography](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html#bibliographies) in RMarkdown.


#### Create a BibTeX File Manually

You can just make a BibTeX file and add citations manually. Make a new Text File in RStudio called "bibliography.bib".

Next, add the line `bibliography: bibliography.bib` to your YAML header.

You can add citations in the following format:

```
@article{shortname,
  author = {Author One and Author Two and Author Three},
  title = {Paper Title},
  journal = {Journal Title},
  volume = {vol},
  number = {issue},
  pages = {startpage--endpage},
  year = {year},
  doi = {doi}
}
```

#### Citing R packages

You can get the citation for an R package using the functions `citation()` and `toBibtex()`. You can paste the bibtex entry into your bibliography.bib file. Make sure to add a short name (e.g., "faux") before the first comma to refer to the reference.

```{r}
citation(package="faux") %>% toBibtex()
```


#### Download Citation Info

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) entries have a BibTeX citation option. This is usually the easiest way to get the relevant values, although you have to add the DOI yourself. 

Some journal websites also let you download citations in bibtex format.
 For example, go to the publisher's page for [Equivalence Testing for Psychological Research: A Tutorial](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2515245918770963), click on the Cite button (in the sidebar or under the bottom Explore More menu), choose BibTeX format, and download the citation. You can open up the file in a text editor and copy the text. It should look like this:

```
@article{doi:10.1177/2515245918770963,
author = {Daniël Lakens and Anne M. Scheel and Peder M. Isager},
title ={Equivalence Testing for Psychological Research: A Tutorial},
journal = {Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science},
volume = {1},
number = {2},
pages = {259-269},
year = {2018},
doi = {10.1177/2515245918770963},

URL = { 
        https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245918770963
    
},
eprint = { 
        https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245918770963
    
}
,
    abstract = { Psychologists must be able to test both for the presence of an effect and for the absence of an effect. In addition to testing against zero, researchers can use the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure to test for equivalence and reject the presence of a smallest effect size of interest (SESOI). The TOST procedure can be used to determine if an observed effect is surprisingly small, given that a true effect at least as extreme as the SESOI exists. We explain a range of approaches to determine the SESOI in psychological science and provide detailed examples of how equivalence tests should be performed and reported. Equivalence tests are an important extension of the statistical tools psychologists currently use and enable researchers to falsify predictions about the presence, and declare the absence, of meaningful effects. }
}
```

Paste the reference into your bibliography.bib file. Change `doi:10.1177/2515245918770963` in the first line of the reference to a short string you will use to cite the reference in your manuscript. We'll use `TOSTtutorial`.

#### Converting from reference software

Most reference software like EndNote, Zotero or Mendeley have exporting options that can export to BibTeX format. You just need to check the shortnames in the resulting file.

#### In-text citations

You can cite reference in text like this: 

```
This tutorial uses several R packages [@tidyverse;@rmarkdown].
```

This tutorial uses several R packages [@tidyverse;@rmarkdown].

Put a minus in front of the @ if you just want the year:

```
Lakens, Scheel and Isengar [-@TOSTtutorial] wrote a tutorial explaining how to test for the absence of an effect.
```

Lakens, Scheel and Isengar [-@TOSTtutorial] wrote a tutorial explaining how to test for the absence of an effect.

#### Citation Styles

You can search a [list of style files](https://www.zotero.org/styles) for various journals and download a file that will format your bibliography for a specific journal's style. You'll need to add the line `csl: filename.csl` to your YAML header. 

<p class="alert alert-info">Add some citations to your bibliography.bib file, reference them in your text, and render your manuscript to see the automatically generated reference section. Try a few different citation style files.</p>


### Output Formats

You can knit your file to PDF or Word if you have the right packages installed on your computer. You can also create presentations, dashboards, websites, and even books with R markdown. In fact, the book you are reading right now was created using R markdown. See [RStudio Formats](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html) for a list of all the output types.

### Computational Reproducibility

Computational reproducibility refers to making all aspects of your analysis reproducible, including specifics of the software you used to run the code you wrote. R packages get updated periodically and some of these updates may break your code. Using a computational reproducibility platform guards against this by always running your code in the same environment.

[Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/) is a platform that lets you run your code in the cloud via a web browser.
